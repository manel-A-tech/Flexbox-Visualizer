Flexbox Visualizer
Overview

The Flexbox Visualizer is a React web application designed to help users learn and experiment with CSS Flexbox in real time.
It allows users to modify container and item properties dynamically and immediately see the effect on the layout.

The project focuses on educational clarity, making it easier for beginners to understand main axis, cross axis, alignment, spacing, and item flexibility.
